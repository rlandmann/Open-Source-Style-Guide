		<title>Active Voice</title>
		<para>
			Use the active voice ("Start Linuxconf by typing...") rather than passive ("Linuxconf can be started by typing...") whenever possible. Active voice makes for more lively, interesting reading.

	 <section id="sect-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Grammar-Agreement">
		<title>Agreement</title>
		<para>
			In grammar, agreement occurs when specific parts of a sentence are coordinated: that is, they "shake hands" in number or gender.
		</para>
		<para>
			There are two forms of agreement: subject-verb agreement and pronoun-antecedent agreement. Subject-verb agreement is pretty rudimentary, so it won't be discussed here. Pronoun-antecedent agreement can be a little more problematic, so...
		</para>
		 <section id="sect-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Agreement-Pronoun_Antecedent_Agreement">
			<title>Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement</title>
			 <para>
				A pronoun is a word that is used in place of a noun (for example, I, he, she, it). An antecedent is a word or a phrase to which the pronoun refers.
			</para>
			<para>
				Once you're comfortable with subject-verb agreement, pronoun- antecedent agreement often follows as a matter of course.
			</para>
			<para>
				Here is an annotated roundup of pronoun-antecedent rules:
			</para>
			 <formalpara id="form-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Pronoun_Antecedent_Agreement-Singular_and_singularplural_and_plural">
				<title>Singular and singular/plural and plural</title>
				 <para>
					Rule: A singular pronoun refers to a singular antecedent; a plural pronoun refers to a plural antecedent.
				</para>

			</formalpara>
			 <para>
				Examples:
			</para>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The CD spins in its caddy. (Singular third-person pronoun its refers to the singular antecedent CD.)
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						The developers checked their work. (Plural third person pronoun their refers to the plural antecedent developers.)
					</para>
				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			 <formalpara id="form-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Pronoun_Antecedent_Agreement-Collective_nouns">
				<title>Collective nouns</title>
				 <para>
					Rule: When collective nouns are used as antecedents, use singular to plural pronouns, depending on the sentence's meaning.
				</para>

			</formalpara>
			 <para>
				Examples:
			</para>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Microsoft seems second to none in its marketing skills (Collective noun "Microsoft" takes a singular pronoun its because the collective noun refers to the group as a whole).
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						The developers were asked for their preferences (Collective noun "developers" takes the plural pronoun their because the reference is to the individuals of the group).
					</para>
				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			 <formalpara id="form-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Pronoun_Antecedent_Agreement-Whowhomthatwhich">
				<title>Who/whom/that/which</title>
				 <para>
					Use "whom," "who," or "that" to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a person. Use "which" when referring to a thing. Use "which" or "that" to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a concept or an object. Who, whom, that, and which are known as "relative pronouns."
				</para>

			</formalpara>
			 <para>
				Use the following as guidelines:
			</para>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Who = relative pronoun when a person (or persons)is the subject
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Whom = relative pronoun when person is not the subject
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Which = relative pronoun for things
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						That = kind of a wildcard; can replace which or who
					</para>

		<title>Sentence Structure</title>
		<para>
			A sentence is one, complete thought. A sentence expresses something about a subject (a person, place, or thing) and a verb (what the subject is or does).
		</para>
		<para>
			There are two common problems that occur in sentence construction: Sentence fragments and run-on sentences.
		</para>
		 <section id="sect-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Sentence_Structure-Sentence_Fragments">
			<title>Sentence Fragments</title>
			 <para>
				A sentence fragment is a sentence which cannot stand by itself -- that is, it's out of context with the surrounding sentences.
			</para>
			 <para>
				Examples:
			</para>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						"We will release no upgrade before its time." Full, complete sentence.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						"We will release no upgrade. At least, before its time." Two sentences, and the second sentence is a fragment, because if it's isolated it can't stand on its own.
					</para>
				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			 <para>
				Try this exercise: Read your sentences aloud, as if each sentence were the *only* sentence on a piece of paper. If you hear a sentence which wouldn't make any sense all by itself, chances are you've got a sentence fragment.
			</para>
			 <para>
				You can choose to repair the sentence by making it a complete thought, or you can choose to adjust it to work as a "stylistic fragment."
			</para>
			 <formalpara id="form-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Sentence_Fragments-Stylistic_fragments">
				<title>Stylistic fragments</title>
				 <para>
					When you choose to maintain a sentence fragment for the sake of variety in your work, you're deciding to use a stylistic fragment.
				</para>
			</formalpara>
			 <para>
				Deliberately inserting a sentence fragment for the sake of style can add color to the work, and help the reader by providing a break in the tone. That's good.
			</para>
			 <para>
				Be careful: Stylistic fragments can easily become a crutch (Too much of a good thing is not a good thing).
			</para>

		 <section id="sect-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Sentence_Structure-Run_on_sentences">
			<title>Run on sentences</title>
			 <para>
				Two or more complete ideas that are joined without punctuation create a run-on sentence (also called a fused sentence). The sentence doesn't have to be long to be a run-on -- although the longer your sentence, the more difficult it is to read.
			</para>
			 <para>
				You can:
			</para>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Separate independent clauses with a period. Doing so will form two sentences out of one.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Use semicolons to form a compound sentence. Think of a semi-colon as an extended breather -- longer than a comma.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Insert a coordinating conjunction, such as "and" or "but" between the independent clauses, which will also form a compound sentence (Rosa Parks was a brave person, but her valor took conviction to stir a nation).
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Insert a subordinating conjunction, which will create a subordinate clause in your sentence and create a compound sentence (Although Rosa Parks was a brave person, her valor took conviction to stir a nation).
					</para>
				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			 <para>
				Examples:
			</para>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Run-on -- The CDs both of which belonged to the developers were in the test lab.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Correct -- The CDs, both of which belonged to the developers, were in the test lab.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Run-on -- The CDs, both of which belonged to the developers, were in the test lab, and because they were the only available CDs for the new release, the developers were anxious about keeping them clean.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Correct -- The CDs, both of which belonged to the developers, were in the test lab. Because they were the only available CDs for the new release, the developers were anxious about keeping them clean (Actually, the previous run-on sentence was technically correct because of the punctuation; however, it could have been broken to help readability).
					</para>

	 <section id="sect-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Grammar-Contractions">
		<title>Contractions</title>
		<para>
			Do not use contractions in formal documentation.
		</para>
	</section>
	
	 <section id="sect-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Grammar-Gender_References">
		<title>Gender References</title>
		<para>
			Do not use gender-specific pronouns in documentation. It is far less awkward to read a sentence that uses "they" and "their" rather than "he/she" and "his/hers." It is fine to use "you" when giving instructions and "the user," "new users," etc. in more general explanations. Never use "one" in place of "you" when writing technical documentation. Using "one" is far too formal.
		</para>
	</section>
	
	 <section id="sect-Manual_for_Writers_and_Publishers-Grammar-Tense">
		<title>Tense</title>
		<para>
			Avoid future tense (or using the term "will") whenever possible For example, future tense ("The screen will display...") does not read as well as the present tense ("The screen displays"). Remember, the users you are writing for most often refer to the documentation while they are using the system, not after or in advance of using the system.
